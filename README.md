# Program Description
Not exactly an original game, but my partner and I decided to try and recreate the famous horror game Five Knights At Freddy (FNAF) for our final coding project in grade 12. It includes almost all the functionality you would see in an actual FNAF game and includes working AI in the animatronics, which have their own unique behaviors and interactions with the game mechanics. Be warned; it is somewhat broken on some devices (things might go off screen, like the right-hand door when you press the button to close it).
